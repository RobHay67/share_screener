# Rules
# 1) Organize your Files Around Features, Not Roles
# 2) Donâ€™t Put Logic in index.js Files
# 3) Place Your Test Files Next to The Implementation
# 4) Use a config Directory
# 5) Put Your Long npm Scripts in a scripts Directory

# components					This directory holds components, tiny self-contained applications that bundle model, view, and controller.
# config						This directory contains the small amount of configuration code that your application will need, including your database configuration 
# 								(in database.yml), your Rails environment structure (environment.rb), and routing of incoming web requests (routes.rb). You can also tailor 
# 								the behavior of the three Rails environments for test, development, and deployment with files found in the environments directory.
